   after gfile is closed
DONE * the addSpring method. (Requires group to be expanded!)

* addHandlerColumnClicked use tcl(obj,"heading", colno, command=function(...) {})
* anchor or expand=TRUE fails with add. -- This needs work!
* addSpring -- isn't

  resize natually. Look into using pixels, characters, ...
* make so container can be tkwin container (ttkframe, ...)
DONE* integrate tktable into gdf
* bidings for Return and Tab in gdf are funny
* Fix toolbar button style in mac os x (Style? THeme?...)
