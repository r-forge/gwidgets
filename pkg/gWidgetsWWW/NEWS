Changes for  0.0-16

Changes for  0.0-12

* fix to localServerStart

Changes for  0.0-11
--------------------

* fix docs to get no warnings in R-devel.

Changes for  0.0-10
--------------------

* Added local server to complement RApache configuration. The local
  server makes development easier as one can see the R process from a
  command line. Also might be useful for stand-alone use as there are
  no toolkits to configure or install. The main quirk between the two
  is how backslashes get escaped in the local server.

* package has copy of extjs libraries (extjs.com)

* addHandlerKeystroke has extra argument key= or charCode= for testing
  keyup keys before sending handler back into R (slower). The key can
  be "e.ENTER" or "e.BACKSPACE" using ext key definitions.

* fixed bug with gcombobox and index=TRUE

* fixes to gprocessingjs -- might be useful with local version

* fix to ggoglemaps to make work with local version

Changes for  0.0-9
--------------------

* make _transportToR use JSON to encode values. This allows one to
  pass back vectors,...

* reworked runHandler. Instead of munging with a key,value pair, we
  have new value context which is a list. It is passed into the
  handler via handlerExtraArguments as in
  Ext.util.JSON.encode({key:value}). Then in the handler h$key is
  value. Used to make ginput work and addHandlerKeystroke (this
  returns key codes though, not characters).

Changes for  0.0-8
--------------------

* Major changes to implement RApache as the backend, in place of
  RPad. The Rpad project seems to be abandoned, despite its very
  interesting core. However, using RApache greatly diminishes the
  security issues that RPad raises and *hopefully* will make
  gWidgetsWWW much more stable

 The configuration of RApache is very important. Sample template in
 templates directory

* requires filehash and digest packages to manage
  sesssions. Sesssion are used to store state between requests

* AJAX features are implemented through a script gWidgetsWWWAJAX.R

* Added gcanvas widget for using the canvas device package of Jeffrey
  Horner. This is replacing the gprocessingjs package, which isn't
  working as of now.

* added gsvg widget which is similar to gcanvas widget. Can be used
  with SVG devices (RSVGTipsDevice, or SVGAnnotation). 

* added gspinbutton widget, although trigger icons not showing.

* removed some CSS for buttons to make work with Internet Explorer

* added ggplot2 example

* fixed bug when adding widgets to layout after rendering.
