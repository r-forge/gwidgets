This directory contains a file to assist in configuring Apache to
run gWidgetsWWW under rapache. The defaults are assuming a standard
ubuntu installation of both apache and rapache (libapache2-mod-r-base).

At a minimum the location of where files are looked for should be configured.
The default searches in the directory /var/lib/gWidgetsWWW and the Examples
directory of the gWidgetsWWW install. The former is not created unless 
you create it. It need not, and should not, be under the directories served
by the web server (e.g. /var/www). The Examples directory is included just
so examples will run without configuration. That directory should not be used
to add files, as it will be overwritten when the package is reinstalled.


To use this with ubuntu requires just a few steps:

1) install gWidgetsWWW -- done if you are reading this likely
2) add the rapache launchpad directory to the sources.list file by appending
these lines to the file /etc/apt/sources.list:

## add R http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/ 
deb http://streaming.stat.iastate.edu/CRAN/bin/linux/ubuntu maverick/
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/jeffreyhorner/rapache/ubuntu lucid main

We used a fixed CRAN site above, you should change as you see fit.

3) install rapache and apache with these shell commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-r-base

4) Copy the file RApache-gWidgetsWWW.conf to the directory 

/etc/apache2/conf.d

(or some other site) and configure it as necessary.

5) restart the apache server

To test, this should show the index:

http://localhost/gWidgetsWWWrun/ex-index.R
