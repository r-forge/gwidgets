## TODO for gWidgetsWWW
* scripts issue: glabel in gsubwindow doesn't work. Should I preload
these? Simple JS call and cleans up code
DONE * actions in general don't seem to be working well (menu, ex-actions)
* gbutton and actions in subwindows 
* integrate hanging events.
DONE * change JS handlers to return strings, not cat it out. Then we could
do something different in local thing
DONE * [<- for i,j and dgf
* update to ext 3.2
(A firefox thing) * size of text in gcombobox is too big. How to change?
* update googlemaps to new API (disabled for now)
* gfile: server version, now its local only
DONE * gcli for local version
* spinbutton trigger icons -- need to work with css to get this going. Wait until part of Ext, not Ext.ux
* menu images (sort out)  makeIconClasses was removed tomake things
  work with IE. This definitely messes up icons in menus???
* gsvg -- need to implement adding a handler. Requires hacking into svg code produced by the device
DONE (local version) * fix ggooglemaps. (integrate RgoogleMaps package)
* Implement  defaultWidget, 
* tree widget -- can do with json example in 3.0. Just put file into static dir and load. What about callbacks?
DONE * createDelegate to pass info to handlers (kye=value) --implement,
  current one is not very good. Needed for ginput, gconfirm? one
  implementation in addHandlerKeystroke but not nice.
DONE * EXT-3.0: install new widgets?
DONE * gwindow -- render to value configurable?
FIXED? * issue with database locking, etc. moved to RDS storage (file per session)
DONE * gcombobox, need to deal with sequencing events -- put each call separate
DONE * Add in canvas package for drawing -- Jeffrey Horner -- question about ctx name
* implement tag, id, isExtant 
* gdf fixes
* forgot to do a popup: addpopupmenu, add3rdmouse ...
* drag and drop functions
* gdf improvements: names<-, row names (EZ), logical, NA values,
  adding columns, adding rows, dates, ... Much more is possible
DIDN"T WORK?* Add in codemirror code: http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/manual.html for gcommandline
DONE * fix issue with IE -- CAN'T -- put in alert box to warn
DONE * addHandlerIdle -- how to repeat call to handler every XXX seconds
DONE * SAFARI broken? why (svalue(button)<-) (global variables needed,
  not local)
DONE * menubar/toolbar icons -- still broken
DONE * ginput, gmessage -- don't work without cat("alert()") in there?? space oddities
* format numbers?
function addCommas(nStr)
{
	nStr += '';
	x = nStr.split('.');
	x1 = x[0];
	x2 = x.length > 1 ? '.' + x[1] : '';
	var rgx = /(\d+)(\d{3})/;
	while (rgx.test(x1)) {
		x1 = x1.replace(rgx, '$1' + ',' + '$2');
	}
	return x1 + x2;
}
DONE * subwindow needs an on-demand scrollbar HOW
* FOr gcomobox we should allow items to be a) a vector b) a data frame
  [DONE} c)a EXTStore object (so that we only print these once) d) a
  URL with some information about how to read it into JSON object
* resizable -- was working, but didn't go into columns, have props error 
  * made optional for now.

## TODO version 0.1
DONE * glaoyt <- character->label, 
* gdf replace NA with ... (see EDF);
* comment on toolbar buttons, make method to generate code.
* documentation
ONE * border -- blue border is annoying
DONE * iron out examples: t-test, windows, layout, widgets, combobox
DONE * gcombo -- check api
DONE * ggooglemaps: working? document here, give examples
DONE * check ginput -- passed in h$input
DONE * gbutton: iconCls vs icon?
DONE* addSpring, addSpace -- define stubs
DONE * gtext -- multiline additoins? -- \\\\n
DONE * label, image code needs to go into display of window -- otherwise
  can't use in a subwindow
DONE * gcombob with vector input -- not working?
DONE * gseparator -- make, but how???
DONE * icons: need for actions -- will this work
  button.XXX{background-image:url(YYY)};
  x = getStockIcons()
  paste("button.",names(x),"{background-image:url(",x,")};", sep="",
  collapse="")
  newN = document.createElement('style')
  newN.innerHTML = paste....
  document.body.appendChild(newN)

DONE * gcombobox: wanted hideTrigger=gedit -- work on this, but found issue
  with values. Should have value, label, icon, tooltip, others
DONE * .$handlerArgs is signal based and can be overridden by an instance
DONE * gmenu, gtoolbar
DONE * gtable: XXX
DONE * fix gradio

DONE * glayout -- simple algorithm is implemented
DONE * ggroup, gframe and gpanedgroup are *all* the same, make it so




FAILED  -------------------------------------
## This didn't work -- doubles up commands for some reason when called prior to loading page and this is only of value ## if done so
* Implement js code to parse params:http://javascript.about.com/library/blqs1.htm
var qsParm = new Array();
function qs() {
var query = window.location.search.substring(1);
var parms = query.split('&');
for (var i=0; i<parms.length; i++) {
var pos = parms[i].indexOf('=');
if (pos > 0) {
var key = parms[i].substring(0,pos);
var val = parms[i].substring(pos+1);
qsParm[key] = val;
}
}
}
