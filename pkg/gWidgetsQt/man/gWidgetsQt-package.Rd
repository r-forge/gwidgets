\title{
Toolkit implementation of gWidgets for Qt
}
\description{
Port of gWidgets API to Qt. The gWidgets API is an abstract,
lightweight means to interact with GUI toolkits. In this case, the Qt
toolkit. 
}
\details{

Containers:
-----------

gwindow: 
Unrealize handler is working. Overrides dispose method though.
If you use a \code{gwindow} instance as a container and pass in the argument \code{do.dockwidget=TRUE} then a the child will be added within a dock widget on the right side of the parent window. Dock widgets can be "undocked".

ggroup:
Need to implement scrollbars, Qt$QScrollArea isn't right (it needs to be populated with children prior to parenting)
Need to implement drag motion raise


gframe:
pos isn't quite right
needs to be drawn better -- style issue?

glayout:

gnotebook:

gexpandgroup:
Rolled my own. using a button to check, should have  trigger icon. Resizing is awful.

gsplitter:
Must size window before using svalue<-

WIDGETS
------

gradio:
remove/block etc need work

glabel: 
need to implement editable


gbutton:
icons -- use gWIdgets stock, but should see about Qt especially for
  standard buttons
shortcuts -- use & in label, then Alt-Key will call clicked
  handler. Eg. gbutton("&Ok") for Alt-O

gedit:
keystroke only covers last letter (not enter, ctrl, ...), Give
character. Need to bind to events, not signals.

gslider;
needs to be integer

gstatusbar:
can add a widget. Pass in index=int to specify where. Default is 1. 0 is
the permanent widget:
sb <- gstatusbar()
gbutton("in statusbar", index=1, cont=sb)

gimage:
Handler reports x and y positions in frame

gtext:
keystroke handler same as for gedit -- just last character

gmenu:
popup menus only for buttons (need to bind to mouse events)

gtable:

gbigtable: uses dataframe.R class to make big tables speedy. Is just for
selection, but has handlers: addHandlerChanged (change in selectino), in
addition to clicked and doublclick. Svalue returns selectino, but
svalue<- not implemented.

gtree:
no multiple selection(?)
chosencol must be first

gdf:
implement do subset (issue with combobo
implement addHandlerColumnRightClick



gsvg:
Need to implement handlers: (no signals in widget)
Doesn't like labels, etc:
svg("file.svg");
hist(rnorm(100));
dev.off();
gsvg("file.svg",cont=gwindow())

METHODS:
---------------
removeHandler, blockHandler, unblockHandler: workin for base widgets. 

addHandlerKeystroke: needs event
addHandlerRightClick: not there

some widgets have events, most use signal. Eventually to get drag and
drop, I need to use the event approach for most of them


addHandlerIdle: working

font<-: working

tooltip<-: working

size<-: sets Minimum size of widget
