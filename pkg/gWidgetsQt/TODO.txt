TODO:
---------
* dnd with gcombobox?
* need to have gbigtable standard for gtable. Michael has changes to incorporate
* settingn child gwindow transient to parent fails as destroyed event
not given
* gexpandgroup: fix resize issues when collapsed
* DND: use QtEvent framework
* gdf: can improve significantly
* gdf -- column clicks -- can do context menu, but how to get column?
* gdfnotebook: How to deal with scratch df, names, column selection, ...
* gmenu under OS X, is odd.

DONE (qtutils) * ggraphics: Is this from qtpaint or qtdevice, seems like the latter
DONE * ggraphics notebook needs writing 
DONE * put in mouse handlers into ggraphics. (click, rubber band?)
DONE * * gvarbrowser -- put in DND for dragging values. R/serialized-data
WORKING ON IT * get bugs fixed for first version
DONE * pass gwidgets tests
DONE aabQtEvent.R * $event -- how to override, virtual function. 
DONE gbigtable (for now) * integerate in dataframe.R functions -- much faster
DONE * dnd -- punted, would need to wrap each in event -- too slow.
DONE * gexpandgroup -- replace checkbox with icon. checkable QFrame
