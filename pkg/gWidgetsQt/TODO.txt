TODO:
---------

* get bugs fixed for first version
* DND: use QtEvent framework
* gdf -- column clicks -- can do context menu, but how to get column?
* gdfnotebook: How to deal with scratch df, names, column selection, ...
* ggraphics: Is this from qtpaint or qtdevice, seems like the latter
* write model for backend to gvarbrowser
* write gdf using bigtable

DONE * pass gwidgets tests
DONE aabQtEvent.R * $event -- how to override, virtual function. 
DONE gbigtable (for now) * integerate in dataframe.R functions -- much faster, but buggy
DONE * dnd -- punted, would need to wrap each in event -- too slow.
