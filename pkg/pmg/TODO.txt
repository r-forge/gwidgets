* Need to rework this, but not until we find the time ;(
-----------------
* BR: remove installed.packages in check -- use something else
* plot.new hook -- see cacher
* Add in global variable ANS via
 makeActiveBinding("ans", function() .Last.value, .GlobalEnv) (GG)

* interface issues: lattice clear too much, bold-faced drop areas not
  obvious; snapshot option for lattice explorer; graph scatter with
  fit for lm
* apres ML, write
  * filebrowser: icons, actions (load, edit, jpg, R, txt, import
   (csv,...))
  * command history (what to do with outputs?)
  * object browser
  * viewer of verctor, matrix data frame, list (gdf)
  * context sensitive -- plot of matrix eg. greyscale
  * cell editor -- ### to delimit cells
  * better text editor (find word at point; find
    block(delimiter="^###"); how to highlight block, etc.
  * see completions code in utils for many useful functions to make
    the command line better
