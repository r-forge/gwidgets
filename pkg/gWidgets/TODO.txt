* STARTED. Wish list: roxygen docs on methods; add classes
* editable<- method? (Really want for gdf, but could use with
  gcombobox, glabel, gtext, ...
* gaction -- parent argument for key.accelerators. Fix on Control-x,
  Alt-x, ... use tcltknotation
* integrate in column size into gtable  size<- (list with columnWidths...)
* gcommandline is not very good -- IT IS AWFUL. Do tcltk --- see
* size argument in gcombobox as formal argument, we have it as ... now.
* methods in docs -- work on API
* visible API (not visible<-) with set is wanky, Should deprecate, but need with gbasicdialog
* gtable -- help page -- check this
DONE * Add multi=FALSE to signature of gfile.
DONE * add use.table to gcheckboxgroup
DONE * fix ggenericwidget under tcltk -- print twice. gcommandline issue I believe.
DONE * fix ghelp to work with windows.
DONE * Write API for these guys, even if they aren't implemented
DONE  * gaction (in gWidgetsWWW)
DONE  * galert -- like gmessage only appears differently (gWidgetsWWW has implementation)
DONE  * ghtml widget (for RwxWidgets, gWidgetsWWW)
DONE  * tooltip (in gWidgetsWWW)
NO * gformlayout -- case to be made that depends on should be done in
 separate pass
DONE * add check for toolkit package on startup, if not there pop up GUI based on what exists.
DONE * Thomas Petzoldt: doc changes to vignetter: Sweave, others. Search email
DONE * tests directory with run tests in each of the toolkits
DONE * add addHandlerMouseOver -- for mouseover effects -- different from
  dropmotion, but similar
DONE * gwindow -- place near a parent window, place in some place
  (setLocatino in rJava), see that TODO
DONE * gwindow -- add in menu, toolbar, contentPane, statusbar
  area. contentPane a "bin"-like container. Done in RGtk2, rJava okay,
  others need implementing
DONE * gframe, gexpandgroup should get a horizontal= argument
DONE * FIX FONTS!! weight <-> style
DONE getToolkitWidget * export .getWidget, .getBlock, .getParent (Michaels request)
DONE * pmg -- close buttons in linux -- read e-mail
DONE? * ggroup == on.dragmotion -- not working under windows, linux OK
  (my guess is that is liew in getWindow()$Raise()
DONE ***** gdf -- error with editing see 20 vs 22
