DIBE * fix ghelp to work with windows -- RPAD?

DONE  * galert -- like gmessage only appears differently (gWidgetsWWW has implementation)
DONE  * ghtml widget (for RwxWidgets, gWidgetsWWW)
DONE  * tooltip (in gWidgetsWWW)
NO * gformlayout -- case to be made that depends on should be done in
 separate pass
